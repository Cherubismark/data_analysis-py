# Python Project: Iris Data Analysis  

## Overview

This project analyzes the Iris dataset using the pandas library for data manipulation and matplotlib for data visualization. The goal is to explore the dataset, find interesting insights, and create clear visualizations.

## Dependencies

- Python 3.7+
- pandas
- matplotlib
- seaborn

Install dependencies:
```bash
pip install pandas matplotlib seaborn
```

## How to Run the Script

1. Make sure you have Python installed on your system.
2. Save the Python script as `iris_analysis.py` in your working directory.
3. Open your terminal and navigate to the directory where `iris_analysis.py` is saved.
4. Run the script using:
```bash
python iris_analysis.py
```

## Steps in the Script

1. **Load Dataset**:
   - Load the Iris dataset using pandas for analysis.

2. **Data Exploration**:
   - Display the first few rows of the dataset to inspect its structure.
   - Check for missing values and handle them if needed.
   - Calculate basic statistics (mean, median, standard deviation).

3. **Basic Analysis**:
   - Group data by the `species` column.
   - Compute averages to identify trends or interesting patterns.

4. **Visualization**:
   - Generate the following plots using matplotlib and seaborn:
     - **Line Chart**: Trends in petal length.
     - **Bar Chart**: Average petal length by species.
     - **Histogram**: Distribution of sepal length.
     - **Scatter Plot**: Sepal length vs. petal length.

## Sample Output

### Console Output:
```plaintext
First 5 rows of the dataset:
   sepal length (cm)  sepal width (cm)  petal length (cm)  petal width (cm)    species
0                 5.1               3.5                1.4               0.2     setosa
1                 4.9               3.0                1.4               0.2     setosa
...
```

### Visualizations:

## Dataset

The Iris dataset is a classic dataset used for classification problems in machine learning. It's publicly available and often accessed from the UCI Machine Learning Repository.

## Next Steps

- Experiment with other datasets.
- Add advanced visualizations such as pair plots or correlation heatmaps.
- Extend the analysis by applying machine learning models to classify species in the dataset.
